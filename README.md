# README

The code in this repo is intended to accompany the tutorial originally published on [my blog](https://www.colby.so/posts/user-notifications-with-rails-noticed-and-hotwire). It demonstrates a basic implementation of real-time user notifications in a Ruby on Rails application, powered by Turbo Streams and [Noticed](https://github.com/excid3/noticed).

Begin in the `main` branch which contains a Rails 7 app with Turbo, Devise, and Tailwind installed, and then check the completed code in the `notifications` branch.

To run this application locally, clone the repo and then:
```
cd user-notices
bin/setup
```
